# Guess-My-Number
Welcome to Guess My Number, a project that brings the excitement of number guessing right to your browser! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive game where you have to guess a hidden number within a specified range.

## Features
- **Four Game Modes:** Challenge yourself with four different game modes: guess the number from 1 to 10, 20, 50, or 100. Choose your preferred difficulty level and put your guessing skills to the test.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of your current score and your all-time high score. Try to beat your previous records and improve your guessing abilities.
- **User-Friendly Controls:** Interact with the game easily using intuitive controls. To submit your guess, simply click the "Check!" button or press the "enter" key. If you need to start a new round, click the "Again!" button or press the "escape" key on your keyboard.
- **Visual Feedback:** Receive immediate visual feedback on your guesses. If you guess the correct number, the background turns green, celebrating your victory. On the other hand, if you exhaust your allowed guesses, the game ends and the background turns red.
